\chapter*{Oh, to be a seagull!}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Oh, to be a seagull!}

Will Powers was the incarnated Will of the Universe, the river of Intention that
shapes the Underlying Superstructure of Reality. But Will did not know that.
Will had never wished for anything so strongly that Reality had to reshape
itself around his wish.

Until that fateful day in Venice, when Will saw the seagull. It was a small
white seagull, perching on a wooden pole, basking in the sun. ``Lucky bird",
Will thought. ``It looks so satisfied. Its life must be so simple". For the
first and last time, Will experienced an all-consuming wish: he wished he lived
the simple life of a seagull. But he was not a seagull. He was the Will of the
Universe. And so the Universe shaped itself around its Will so that Will was a
seagull. Will had always been a seagull and there had never been a universe in
which Will had not been a seagull.

And Will had been right about the simplicity of the seagull life. At the moment
immediately following Will's transformation, a simple wish dominated every other
thought in his seagull brain: \emph{fish}. The seagull wished for fish. The Will
of the Universe, incarnated as a seagull, wished for fish. And the Universe
shaped itself around its Will so that the seagull had all the fish that it
wanted. All the fish that had ever existed.

Later, in the limited time that remained to humanity before the inevitable end
of all life as the Earth spiralled away from the Sun, it was estimated that the
mass of fish that suddendly materialsed on top of the Italian peninsula,
smothered its neighbouring countries, covered the Mediterrannean and spilled
over the Alps, across the vast plains of Africa and through the straights of
Gibraltar into the Atlantic Ocean was about $1.8 \times 10^{-2}$ Earth masses,
or a little over the mass of our moon. In any case, it was enough to knock the
Earth out of its orbit. It made no difference as the world plunged into war
following a vicious recession brought on by the collapse of all fishing
industry.

As the Earth careered madly into space, amid the ruins of the once proud
capitals of Europe ghostly husks of men and women roamed the deserted streets,
looking for sustenance. But not one of them dared venture South, towards the
Sea. Not one could stand to go towards the ungodly stench of rotting fish.

% Version 3 - Almost there, just right with edits
%Will Powers was the incarnated Will of the Universe, the river of Intention that
%shapes the formless Flow of information in the Underlying Superstructure of the
%Universe, thus yielding Reality. But Will knew nothing of that. Will had never
%wished for anything strongly enough to reshape Reality to achieve it.
%
%Until that fateful day in Venice when Will saw the seagull. It was a small white
%seagull, of a species common in the Mediterrannean. It was perching on a wooden
%pole, basking in the sun. ``Lucky bird", Will thought. ``Look at it. It looks so
%satisfied. I bet there's nothing it ever wants that it can't simply get". For
%the first and last time in his life, Will experienced an all-encompassing,
%all-consuming wish: he wished he was a seagull. But he was not a seagull. He was
%the Will of the Universe. And so the Universe shaped itself around its Will so
%that Will was a seagul. Will had always been a seagull and there had never been
%a universe in which Will had not been a seagul.
%
%And Will had been right about the simplicity of seagulls' wishes. At the moment
%immediately following Will's transformation, a simple wish dominated every other

%of the Universe, incarnated as a seagull, wished for fish. And the Universe
%shaped itself around the Will so that the seagull had all the fish that ever
%existed.
%
%Later, in the limited time that remained to humanity before the inevitable end

%that suddendly materialsed on top of the Italian peninsula, smothered its
%neighbouring countries, covered the Mediterrannean and spilled over the Alps,
%across the vast plains of Africa and through the straights of Gibraltar to cover
%the Atlantic Ocean was about $1.8 \times 10^{-2}$ Earth masses, or a little over
%the mass of our moon, enough to knock the Earth out of its orbit. The world
%plunged into war following a vicious recession brought on by the collapse of all
%fishing industry.
%
%As the Earth careened madly into space, away from the lifegiving light of our
%sun, amid the ruins of the once proud capitals of Europe, ghostly husks of men
%and women roamed the deserted streets, looking for sustanance. But not one of
%them dared venture South, towards the Sea. Not one dared to go towards the
%ungodly stench of rotting fish.


% Version 2 - almost there, just a couple of lines over.
%Will Powers was the incarnation of the Will of the Universe, the directionless
%river of consciousness that imposes order onto the chaotic Flow of information
%in the Underlying Superstructure of the Universe, yielding reality. But Will
%knew nothing of that. Will was a simple man with simple wishes that had never
%required the Universe to reshape itself around his Will to be fullfilled.
%
%Until that fateful day in Venice when Will saw the seagull. It was a small
%white seagull, of a species common in the Mediterrannean. ``How elegant``, Will
%thought. ``It looks nothing like the ones we have back home. Those are as big as
%chickens. And look at it. It looks so happy. So content. I bet there's nothing
%it ever wants that it can't simply get``. At that point, Will had the first and
%last true wish of his life: for a split second, he wished he was a seagull. But
%he was not a seagull. He was the Will of the Universe. And so the Universe
%shaped itself around the Will so that Will was a seagul. Will had always been a
%seagull and there had never been a universe in which Will had not been a seagul.
%
%And will was right about the simplicity of seagulls' wishes. They were simple
%wishes. At the moment immediately following Will becoming a seagull, he felt one
%wish that dominated every other thought in his seagull brain: fish. The seagull
%wished for fish. The Will of the Universe, incarnated as a seagull, wished for
%fish. And the Universe shaped itself around the Will so that the seagull had
%fish.
%
%Later, in the limited time that remained to humanity before the inevitable end
%as the Earth spiralled away from the Sun, it was estimated that the mass of fish
%that suddendly materialsed on top of the Italian peninsula, smothered its
%neighbouring countries, covered the Mediterrannean and spilled over the Alps,
%across the vast plains of Africa and through the straights of Gibraltar to cover
%the Atlantic Ocean was about $1.8 \times 10^{-2}$ Earth masses, or about the
%size of our moon. None of that mattered of course, as the planet was plunged
%into war following a vivious recession brought on by the collapse of all fishing
%industry.
%
%As the Earth careened madly into space, away from the lifegiving light of our
%sun, amid the ruins of the once proud capitals of Europe, ghostly husks of men
%and women roamed the deserted streets, looking for sustanance. But not one of
%them dared venture South, towards the Sea. Not one dared to go towards the
%ungodly stench of rotting fish.

% Version 1. I like it but it overflows by a page.
%William (Will) Powers was the incarnation of the Will of the Universe. He didn't
%know he was the Will of the Universe incarnate, because he never wished for
%anything, because the Will wishes nothing, because the Will is a directionless
%flow of consciousness that has no wants, or needs. Will had often wished for
%small things, like a glass of water, or a piece of cake, but those were small
%wishes readily fulfilled by ordinary means: getting up to pour himself a glass
%of water, or asking his grandmother to give him a piece of cake. He had never
%had a burning wish, a wish so strong that it could only be fullfilled by a
%rearranging of the structure of the universe. For such is the function of the
%the Will of the Universe: to impose structure on the chaotic Flow of the world.
%
%Will knew none of that. He had never wished for anything. Until that fateful day
%when he saw the seagull in Venice.
%
%Will had visited Venice with a stag party, to celebrate his friend John's
%marriage. The day after they had arrived, nursing a savage hangover, Will was
%half-sitting, half-lying at the back of a vaporeto sailing down the Canal
%Grande. He was staring distractedly at the medieval architecture, the
%half-submerged entrances of the old palazzos, the moorings attached to each
%building. Then he saw the seagull.
%
%It was a white male seagull, of a species common in the Mediterrannean, smaller
%than the big seagulls of the British Isles that Will was more accustomed to. By
%contrast to Will's miserable disposition, the seagull looked... content. ``Look
%at it``, Will thought. ``There isn't anything it wants that it can't get. Its
%needs are simple, its life is so easy``. Momentarily, Will experienced his
%first, and last, passionate wish: for a split second only, he wished, fervently,
%with all his heart, that he was a seagull. But he was not a seagull. He was the
%incarnation of the Will of the Universe. And so the Universe shaped itself
%around the Will so that Will was a seagull. Will had always been a seagull and
%there had never been a universe in which Will had not been a seagull.
%
%And Will had been right about the seagull's wishes. They were simple wishes. At
%the moment immediately following Will's transformation into a seagull, he felt
%one wish that dominated every other thought of his seagull brain: fish. The Will
%of the Universe, in its seagull incarnation, wished for fish; and the Universe
%shaped itself around this wish, so that the seagull had fish.
%
%The seagull had all the fish it wanted. The seagull had all the fish in the
%world.  He had always had all the fish in the world, ever since there was a
%world and ever since there were fish. Later, in the limited time that remained
%to humanity before the ineviable end, it was estimated that the mass of the fish
%that suddendly materialised on top of the Italian peninsula, smothered its
%neighbouring countries, covered the Mediterrannean and spilled over the Alps and
%across the vast plains of North Africa, and through the Straights of Gibraltar
%into the Atlantic Ocean, was about $1.8 \times 10^{-2}$ Earth masses, or a
%little over the mass of the moon. Simultaneously, every gram of fish biomass
%disappeared from the Earth's seas. The sudden appearance of such a mass
%concentrated on one small area of the surface of the planet was sufficient to
%kick the Earth out of its orbit and set it on a spiralling path away from the
%Sun. The few human scientists who had the time to figure it all out estimated
%that the Earth would probably slignshot through the Solar System, escaping the
%Sun's pull, to become a rogue planet. Of course, this would wipe out all life
%from the face of the Earth and most of the life in its oceans except for the few
%creatures gathered around hydrothermal vents, who would go on for a few more
%million years, perhaps.
%
%In the meantime, the fishing industry collapsed within days and took with it the
%global economy that sunk in a vicious recession that made 2009 look like the
%good times. War followed, probably started by the Scandinavian countries and
%Russia, although the few survivors of the nuclear disaster had very little
%opportunity to find any reliable information. The world sank into barbarity.
%Curtain fell on the once proud human civilisation.
%
%Amid the ruins of the capitals of Europe, ghostly husks of men and women roamed
%the deserted streets, looking for sustenance. But nobody dared venture towards
%the South, towards the Mediterrannean. Nobody dared to go near the ungodly
%stench of uncountable metric tons of rotting fish.

% TODO: I don't think the Earth can really be knocked out of its axis that way
% but it's dramatically consistent.


\chapter*{Escape}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Escape}

Another day behind bars, the Prisoner sighs and lugs a bag of refuse to the
bins. He hauls it over and he sees a door behind the bin. A little wooden door
out of a fairy-tale. He kneels to push it open. He crawls through to a green
field under a blue sky. He crushes the smell of daisies. The sun shines. Birds
sing. Insects buzz. It's Spring. It's freedom. Drunk with it he escapes.

He meets a black woman in the middle of the field. She's pitch black, like coal
and only her eyes are white. She looks like a cutout: the cutout of
\emph{Woman}. He falls to his knees in reverence after years in a ward of men.
She is a prisoner, too, she says. The Gaoler has shut her in this gilded cage
for malice. Will he not help her escape? They can live together in his world.
Escape? He is still in prison!

He leads the Black Woman by the hand. His prison was built by the Gaoler around
her own. It is a kind of fail-safe. She can leave the green-growing world prison
if she's led from it by a man from the other side. But she has to be led from
the outer prison, too. The Prisoner will have to break her out.

They reach the door. The prisoner goes first. He turns, half-fearing to find
blind wall. He takes her hand, guides her in. She's out. With a savage claw she
strikes and sends him in a broken heap. For the first time he sees her scales;
her hooves; the snakes on her head. He smells rotting fish and dead whale where
she crushed his face. She shrieks in rage, You! You thought you! Would have me!
Her voice rises and Rises and RISES and his eardrums explode. The world
explodes. The prison descends into chaos, men driven mad by her scream.
%Her voice rises and Rises and RISES and his eardrums are ruptured. The world is

The Gaoler appears in a sheath of light. A tall, handsome man (or is it a
woman?) with flowing locks, in a silver robe. He wields a sword of fire and
wears a face of thunder. He has golden wings and a halo of light. He strides
towards the Black Woman as the Prisoner croaks an angel, an angel! Your jailer
is an angel! I freed the devil, I freed a beast!

The last thing he sees is the Gaoler raising his sword and charging the Black
Woman, now fully revealed in her gorgon form.

\chapter*{Enorastron}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Enorastron}

Every prophetic book, every holy book, that has ever been written, was once
written. Therefore, it was written by a human hand. The Enorastron, the Book of
Insights, was never written. Therefore, it was not written by a human hand. The
Enorastron can only be transcribed once read, its text traced in the shapes of
clouds, in the wrinkling of the sea, in the tap-tap-tapping pattern of the rain,
in the turbulence of the wind, in the crackling of fire, in the frequencies of
earthquakes, the sound of thunder, the movement of humans in a crowded city, the
flickering of the Northern lights... the smoke over the ruins of ancient
empires, tea leaves, rolling dice, shooting stars, solar flares, schools of
fish, swarms of bees, flights of birds, accidents, death, disease, birth and
happinness and love and light and darkness, the birth of elementary particles
and the death of mighty stars. The Enorastron can only be read in dreams of
fever, in moments of pleasure, in flashes of pain. Its readers are only the mad,
the dying, the lost, the drugged, the simple and the pure. The Enorastron can
only be read briefly, fragmentarily, here a short phrase that scars the mind
with its inescapable truth; there a longer passage that consumes reason with its
undeniable clarity. Sometimes, a whole page is read and the reader burns in a
column of mystical flame, for ever to leave the world because her mind,
overflowing with forbidden truth cannot any more be contained by the fragile
reality inhabited by human brains. Rarely, a reader lasts for an entire section,
maybe once or twice for an entire chapter. So witnessed the ancient masters of
old, the wise alchemists and the lost shamans of the time before history. But
the Enorastron could not be read from start to end, like an ordinary book, even
if a mind as strong existed to withstand its searing catarract of revelations.
Because the Enorastron has no end and it has no beginning. The text of the
Enorastron does not begin and it does not end. It exists forever and everywhere
and is written before the existence of time itself. The Enorastron would not fit
in the mind of a single human, of all humankind, of all intelligent life in the
Universe. The Enorastron would not fit in the Universe itself. The Enorastron
does not exist in the Universe itself.  Rather, the Universe itself exists
inside the text of the Enorastron.

%Because the Enorastron has no end and no beginning, its text goes on forever and

%She watched him throughout the night, putting people under it. He tried it on
%her a couple of times but of course it didn't work. At length, he realised. He

%
%- So, you have the Power! he laughed.
%
%- And you're a cunt. She said.
%
%He was taken aback.
%
%- I've been watching you all night. You keep doing it. You're putting eveyrone
%under it. You're taking advantage of them. Making them do things.
%
%- Well, that's the Power. You tell people what you want and they make it happen
%for you. What do you expece me to do?
%
%Suddendly, he threw back his head and laughed.
%
%- Oh, don't tell me! You're one of those people. Those idealists. You don't use
%the power, because it causes harm? You think you're some kind of hero, a
%protector of the weak, you use your power for good, not evil.
%
%He knocked back his drink and looked disgusted.
%
%- You are not like them. You should dominate them, like you can. You should live

%- I don't see you living like a king. she pointed out. What happen? Did you fall

%
%He scoffed.
%
%- "Fell from grace"? The power can backfire. We all know that. Then you fall on
%your ass. So what? That's the way it is. It hurt the first few times but I'm
%used to it now. I just haul myself back up. I got the Power.
%
%- "The power can backfire..."? That's a nice, self-deceiving narrative you got
%there. The power doesn't backfire. You just can't handle it. Everytime you abuse
%it you set things in motion that you can't understand and you can't control.
%Then they come back and bite you in the ass. An idealist? I'm just not an idiot.

%
%He smiled nervously. He felt strangely subdued. Maybe she was putting it on to

%They went off and had sex anyway. To have sex when you both had the Power was

a queen among them".

%- Oh, don't tell me! You're one of those people. Those idealists. You don't use
%the power, because it causes harm? You don't use your powe for evil? He knocked
%back his drink and looked disgusted.

%\noindent
``I don't see you living like a king. What happened? Did you fall from grace?".

%\noindent
``Fall from grace?". He scoffed. ``The Power can backfire. We all know that.
Then you fall on your ass. It hurt the first few times but I'm used to it now. I
just haul myself back up. I got the Power, after all".

%\noindent
``The power can backfire...? What a nice story. The `power' doesn't `backfire'.
You just can't handle it. Everytime you abuse it you set things in motion that
you can't understand and you can't control. Then they come back and bite you in
the ass. To be a cunt is its own punishment".

He smiled nervously. He felt strangely subdued. Maybe she was putting it on to
him. Maybe she was more powerful than him. Or maybe she was just right. He
stared into his drink, forlorn. He felt like a sack of insects.

They went off together and had sex anyway. To have sex when you both had the
Power was not an opportunity you passed up. At least she was nice to him the
rest of the night and she didn't make him feel like an idiot anymore.

He wasn't really a bad guy, was he?

Olive was taking a walk in the park when she saw the mechanism, at the time in
its base form of a small lattice of plasma emanating from a metallic stem in the
shape of a rose twig. She stopped and stared at it, uncomprehending.

%The mechanism sensed her approach and her staring. After Olive hadn't moved a
%muscle for a long while, the mechanism grew concerned that she would suffocate -
%she seemed to have ceased voluntary breathing. It decided that it should
%acknowledge her presence and its ability to sense her presence. It seemed
%appropriate to begin by taking on a shape that would be familiar to her. It
%turned itself into a small, black, laptop computer with the sigil of the Order
%of Engineers on the lid, pulsating slowly between shades of black and total
%darkness.

The mechanism sensed her approach and her staring. After Olive hadn't moved a
muscle for a long while, the mechanism grew concerned that she would suffocate -
she seemed to have ceased voluntary breathing. It decided that it should

appropriate to begin by taking on a shape that would be familiar to her. It
turned itself into a small, black, laptop computer with the sigil of the Order
of Engineers on the lid, pulsating slowly between shades of total darkness.

Olive took a step sideways, half-stumbled, half-dropped on the bench next to
where the mechanism was lying on the ground and sat there for the next several
hours, staring. The mechanism was relieved to see that she had resumed
breathing, but it now worried that she might suffer lasting psychological
damage.

%``Hi there!" it said, creating for itself what it hoped was a soothing voice of
%an eldery woman. ``I am a device created by the Order of Engineers, a very
%secret organisation that has existed for two thousand years. The Order possesses
%advanced science and technology that they curate for the sake of humanity's

invasion of the Earth by an alien superintelligence, or something even worse".

``Even \emph{worse}?" croaked Olive; and promptly felt stupid that this was what
she thought to ask at this very moment. Then again, it was not an unreasonable
question: what could be worse than an invading alien superintelligence?

%Out of the torrent of questions and guesses at their answers that flooded
%Olive's brain at that moment, she chose those two words. Then again, it was a

``I'm afraid so, yes. The Order may have lost control of one of our own".

%``What do you expect me to do, then?" croaked Olive.
``But what do you expect me to do, about that?" croaked Olive.

%``Well. Do you know any programming"? asked the device.

First came a great armada: thousands of black ships eclipsing the stars.

Their planetary defense systems tore each ship to pieces.

Next came three ships: one ship of stellar fire, one ship of solid sound and one
of dark energy to shield the other two from harm.

They sent a swarm of nanomachines that disrupted the defense systems of the dark
energy ship. Their surface-to-space cannons made short work of the other two.

Third came a single silver ship shaped like an eagle's solitary wing, armed with
a golden weapon that threatened the stars.

They infected it with a toxic film of biomechanical matter. It dissolved the
ship to silver dust and its gun to golden confetti.

The people laughed and cheered. ``We are unassailable" they assured each other,
patting each other on the back. ``Technological superiority is ours". They
drank and danced and sang and loved, each day for months without end.

They were dragged from their revelries, bleary-eyed and light-headed, at the
sound of the klaxons from the planetary defense system; at the flash of the
warnings of an incoming threat. Alarmed, they rushed to their consoles and
looked at their instruments to locate the source of the warnings.

At length, they found a stranger striding purposefully towards their largest
%city. He was clearly one of them, an invader from beyond the stars. But he did
city. He was clearly one of \emph{them}: an invader from beyond the stars. But
he did not look the part! He had long, matted hair and an unkempt beard and he
was dressed in tattered robes. He walked barefoot. He held an ancient stick of
solid black wood. A grim look of disappointment furrowed his stern brow and his
sapphire eyes smoldered.

The people cheered and wooped and hailed their final victory. They had defeated
the thousand-strong armada and destroyed the ship that killed the stars. Surely,
that lone man, dressed in beggar's robes, was coming as a penitent, to declare
unconditional surrender and offer the terms of peace.

\noindent
- Is it true that humans can make fire? asked a child.

\noindent
- And that they can fly higher than the clouds? And talk to each other over
great distances? asked another.

\noindent
- And breathe under the water, too? asked a third.

\noindent
- I heard they went all the way to the moon! And they cured all sickness!

\noindent
- What is ``sickness"?

They were all a-titter. The old lady nodded.

\noindent
- Yes, it's true. Humans could do all of those things, in the old days.

\noindent
- What about today? Can you make fire? Show us!

The children cheered. They twinkled like christmas lights.

She fumbled in the folds of her outer layers and brought forth a little thing.

She rubbed it and it clicked and cracked and a little flame stood on its top.

\noindent
- Look! It's fire!

\noindent
- It's a small fire...

\noindent
- It could make a bigger fire. It could make any fire!

\noindent
- It's true! The children sang. Humans can make fire!

\noindent
- Show us more! they begged. Show us how you fly! Breathe underwater! Fly to the
moon!

The old lady shifted uncomfortably on her log, in front of her cave-home.

\noindent
- I can't, she said. Not any more. We don't have any of that anymore. We've lost it all.

The children looked crestfallen.

Soon they regained their energy and drifted away, carried by the evening breeze,
blinking and sparkling and hovering between the trees with youthful vigour.

Under the giant ruins of civilisation the old woman sat crying for all the
treasures and the might humanity had lost.

- Dylan has a vagina!

\noindent
- You mean he's transgendered? What, Dylan? No way!

\noindent
- No, no. I mean, he \emph{has} a vagina. In the back of the house. He showed it
to me.

\noindent
- In the back of the ... what, he's got someone there?

\noindent
- No. It's a vagina. It's on the wall. It looks like... like a door, or
something. A door to ... somewhere? He says he peeked.

\noindent
- He \emph{peeked}? How did he... Oh no! Don't tell me he... ! Yeeeew!

\noindent
- Yeah, he put his head through. He says it's a whole 'nother world in there.

\noindent
- Inside the vagina? That's hanging from the wall? Like a painting?

\noindent
- It's not \emph{hanging}! Will you listen? It's like, like a portal. To another
dimension.

\noindent
- Uh-huh. But it's a vagina.

\noindent
- I mean, it's got lips and a clit and hair and all. It's made of meat.

\noindent
- Meat?

\noindent
- Flesh, you know? It's like the real thing. Only it's about four feet high and
you can sort of, you know, you can squeeze through...

\noindent
- You haven't...!

- No, not me! But it's Dylan. He's gone.

\noindent
- What you mean gone?

- I can't find him. I've been calling him since Monday. He's not on facebook
either.

\noindent
- What now?

She was chosen to guard the flame. Like her father and her grandmother before
her, she would guard the flame with her life and give it her last dying breath.
The undying flame, the spirit of her people, gifted by the gods to their
forefathers for ever to light their path and warm their revels, a beacon to
guide them to the afterlife.\\

\noindent
- Well it wasn't very ``undying" then, was it?

\noindent
- Yes but that's because you were supposed to not let it go out, ever.

\noindent
- No but in that case, why call it ``undying"?

\noindent
- Because you don't let it die?

\noindent
- But then, if it can die, it's not an undying flame, is what I'm saying. It's
just an ordinary, old flame. Isn't it? We can just light it back up again and
there's no harm done.

\noindent
- No harm done? No harm done! It's the Undying Bloody Flame and you are its
guardian. And you let it die! You failed in your duty!

\noindent
- Hey, keep it down with the yelling. Do you want someone to hear?

\noindent
- But she bloody let the bloody flame bloody die!

%- Yeah? And you know what they'll do to us if they find out?

\noindent
- Look, I've lit it back up. It's burning again. OK? Alright? Nobody has to
know.

\noindent
- Noone must ever know.

\noindent
- Nobody will ever know.

\noindent
- I won't tell if you don't.\\

In the year of the Black Nightingale, the Guardian of the Flame allied herself
with two brave men from the Order of Priests and the Lodge of the Warriors of
Light. They formed the Secret Society of the Guardians of the Secrets of the
Undying Flame, that forever keeps the secrets of the undying flame. Great is
their power and deep is their wisdom. And noone has ever learned their Secrets.

% - This is a central paradox of your act, and this court would really wish it

% grounds, to save the millions of lives lost to air pollution from burning of
% fossil fuels, not to mention the countless lives that are put in risk from a
% changing climate. And yet you have-... How can your actions be reconciled with
% your undeniable humanitarianism?
% 
% - Your honour ... People are afraid of dying; but more than that, are afraid of
% dying \emph{badly}. Death from radiation poisoning is an ugly, fearsome death
% that is made all the more fearsome by its extreme rarity. Death from the effects
% of air pollution is no less ugly - but we have all become accustomed to living
% in cities swamped in deadly air and this fear has lost its edge. Scientists have
% used this fact, and peoples' so-called ``irrational" fear of aviation accidents,
% or shark attacks, to argue that humans are bad at statistical reasoning, because
% we are more afraid of such events of extreme rarity than we are of commonplace
% events that carry no lesser risk, like road traffic accidents or, indeed, death
% from disease caused by air pollution. But humans are not irrational. We all know
% we will die and we are very reasonably afraid of spending our last conscious
% moments in agony and pain. The fear of dying alone, away from your loved ones,
% sealed in a metal tube with panicking strangers screaming and crying... being
% torn apart by the teeth of a large predator while simultaneously drowning...
% those are not irrational fears. Those are very well justified, very reasonable
% fears. And so is the fear of dying in a radiological accident, killed by an
% invisible fire, burning from the inside, your limbs blackened and blistered,
% your skin sloughing off in sheets, blinded, confused and vomiting. But this fear
% will not go away until it becomes commonplace and ordinary, like the fear of
% dying crushed to a pulp in your car, or coughing blood after a lifetime of
% breathing burned air. Fear of radiation will not go away until death from
% radiation becomes a fact of life.  And until then, millions will die from the
% effects of air pollution and billions of unborn children in future generations
% will be deprived of their very lives because of climate change.
% 
% - So to save billions, you sacrificed millions.
% 
% - To save the billions who will die a pedestrian death that they are not afraid
% of anymore, millions had to die a strange and cruel death that they deeply fear.

%your undeniable, counscious and bold humanitarianism?

%- Your honour... People are afraid of dying, but more than that, are afraid of
%dying \emph{badly}.
%
%Death from radiation poisoning can be really ugly. If you read about the
%symptoms of the victims of radiological accidents, it's like something out of an
%H. P. Lovecraft novel- their skin sloughs off, they have radiation burns inside
%their bodies, their limbs blister and blacken... It is a horrible, fearsome
%death. 
%
%And it's made worse by the fact that it is so rare. It is rare exactly because
%nuclear power is so rarely used.
%
%On the other hand, death from air pollution is no less horrible. Chronic
%pulmonary obstructive disease, lung cancer, spitting blood, living the last
%years of your life on oxygen...
%
%But people are less afraid of dying like this than they are of dying from
%radiation. Why?
%
%I say it is exactly \emph{because} death from radiation sickness is so rare and
%death from the effects of air pollution is so common. We have all internalised
%the knowledge that we live in cities where the air is full of deadly substances
%that we breathe in constantly, and that they destroy our health and cause us to
%die in misery and pain. The thought is so common it's not even voiced aloud
%anymore and the fear we all feel about it has lost its edge, exactly because we
%never stop to feel it. We \emph{know} we breathe in death with every breath. We
%go off to find the ``clean air" of the countryside, we say. We know that the
%city air is ``dirty". But we are so used to it that the alarm bells have stopped
%ringing and everyone goes about their daily business, as if nothing's the
%matter.
%
%In the same way, people are afraid of flying, or afraid of sharks. Air travel is
%relatively safe, but dying alone, away from your loved ones, in a sealed metal
%tube full of strangers screaming and crying, is everyone's worst nightmare. Very
%few people are eaten by sharks, but being torn apart by the teeth of a large
%predator is not how most people would choose to go, if they had a choice.
%
%Scientists have pointed to such ``irrational" fears, as the fear of flying or
%the fear of shakrs, to argue that humans are bad at statistical reasoning. But
%this only fails to recognise the very rational and very reasonable fears that
%every human being carries constantly in his or her heart of hearts: the fear of
%oblivion; and the fear of painful death. The fear of spending your last moments
%in the world in fear and agony. Scientific models of human reasoning fail to
%account for the most human characteristic of all: our recognition of our own
%fragility.
%
%Because of these ``irrational" fears I have convinced myself that nuclear power
%will not be widely adopted until death from it becomes commonplace and ordinary,
%like death from road traffic accidents, or death from the effects of air
%pollution. Until death from radiation sickness becomes accepted as just a fact
%of life, we will not see a wide adoption of nuclear power. And the consequences
%that you have described yourself will not be avoided. Billions of people,
%currently alive and in future generations, will suffer and die because of
%climate change. Air pollution from the burning of fossil fuels for energy
%production will continue to kill millions.
%
%Therefore, to save billions - millions had to die.

Juan and Genaro told me this story, one drunken night in Paris. Or maybe it was

neighbours were yelling and banging on the walls, but he wouldn't stop.

He started belting ``ON A DARK DESERT HIGHWAY! COLD WIND IN MY HAAAIR!". There

souls and there lived the People of the Masks. They were called that, because
they always wore masks. They all wore them, since the day they were born. They
grew up with their masks and maintained and enlarged them as they grew. The
masks where painted with markings that described the wearer's personality- the
markings \emph{were} the wearer's personality. If the markings on the mask
signified happiness, the person wearing the mask was happy and lovable. If the
markings on the mask symbolised violence, the person was a violent murderer.  If
the markings meant cooking prowess, the person was a great cook. The elders of
the village chose the masks according to the needs of the village. If the
village needed hunters, a newborn would be given a mask with marks that meant
the wearer was a great hunter. And so on. When the people died, their masks went
on: they were given to a newborn baby, or sometimes the markings on a mask would
be transferred to a new mask while the original mask was ritually destroyed.
Thus, the personalities of the masks lived on, even as the bodies of the people
died. The people achieved immortality by foresaking individuality.

I declared my incredulity at the preposterous idea that a mask would determine a
person's personality. ``You can't become a hunter just by putting on a mask!" I
protested. Genaro stopped with the noise and joined in. Yes, you can, he assured
me, ``as long as you start early enough". If you wore a mask your whole life, he
said, don't you think you, too, would start thinking it was your real you?

I remained unconvinced. ``There would have been dissidents" I complained.
``Rebels. People who were unhappy with the masks they were given".  ``Oh yes,
there were unhappy people" Juan agreed. He said that people could be very
unhappy with their lot in life, but they didn't have much choice but to accept
it, because the entire life of the village was built around the masks and there
was nowhere else to go. The village was in the middle of a wild jungle, filled
with ferocious beasts and all kinds of mortal dangers.

Genaro added that the elders' decisions didn't always make sense. It was not
unheard of, for example, when the village had too few people of one sex, for the
elders to try to make up for the deficit by giving a mask of the minority sex to
a child of the other sex, so that a male child would be given a female mask, or
vice-versa. A female child given a male mask would then be brought up as male,
take on a male profession and even marry another female. The two would sleep
together as husband and wife and, in due time, the wife would go down to the
river and ``give birth", then she would come back and announce that the ``baby"
was stillborn.  Othertimes, they would put a rock in a cot and even put a mask
on it and treat it as a child, that ``died" later on. They would even go so far
as to make a full effigy of a human child, put a mask on it and care for it
until the parents died, at which point the effigy would also be buried and the
mask passed on to someone else. Thus the masks procreated even if their wearers
didn't.

``So what happened to the people of the masks?" I asked. ``Are they still
around"? 

Genaro smirked: ``Well, theirs was not a very practical way to live, especially
in the middle of a jungle. They all died out".

``Wait a minute" I snorted. ``This is just another one of your allegorical
tales, isn't it? The People of the Masks are us, the village is the Earth and
the dangerous jungle is the universe".

They denied this vehemently. The story of the People of the Masks was real, they
said. Juan swore that he had seen them with his own eyes and Genaro made
supportive noises and nodded vigorously to show his agreement.

``You should stop thinking everything we say is an allegory" Juan said.

``You're not making it easy" I retorted.

%``Oh? Have I told you the story of the Bears that Shit in the Woods by any
%chance?"
%``Oh? Have I told you The Story of The Bears that Shit in the Woods?"
%``Maybe I should tell you The Story of The Bears that Shit in the Woods."
%``Maybe we should tell The Story of The Bears that Shit in the Woods." said
%Genaro.
%``Have we told you The Story of The Bears That Shit in the Woods?"
Genaro raised a didactic finger. ``Maybe we should tell The Story of The Bears
that Shit in the Woods."

At that, they both started laughing their silly heads off. Oh, how they laughed.
They laughed, and Laughed and LAUGHED until they slid off the couch and rolled
on the floor writhing in big spasms of mirth.

We kept drinking, and talking, and singing, late into the night, and Genaro kept
trying to play his horrible hurdy-gurdy. Or was it an accordion? I am not so
sure anymore. We drank and laughed and talked and laughed until the morning.
This was a long time ago in Paris. Or maybe it was Rome. I haven't seen those
two idiots for a long time and I miss them, I miss them, and I miss their
wonderful, outrageous stories.

\chapter*{A Little Blue Alien Marble}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{A Little Blue Alien Marble}

Jane is a telepath. She's in contact with an alien entity beyond the
constellation of Cygnus. The alien is alone, travelling in space, at subluminar
speeds, its home destroyed, the last one of its kind. Jane is overcome by an
incredible sadness. The loneliness of deep space forever. She befriends the
alien. She can see it with her mind's eye. It's like a small blue marble, made
of sparkly metal. It travels in a tiny vessel, not much larger than the alien
itself. It looks like a kid's toy in a matchbox.

The alien is curious about Jane's life, the Earth, the Sun and the solar system.
It can't reach the solar system from its current position but it is working to
triangulate its location. It reassures Jane: it's the only one of its kind.
There are no others. There never were others. It is a species consisting of a
single individual. It does not reproduce, and so does not need resources to
propagate its copies, as life does. It is no threat. It is only curious, a
scientist, an entity of knowledge. It is not interested in conquering alien
worlds and exterminating their inhabitans to install its own population.

Jane looks up astrological charts online and shares them with the alien. The
alien can now see the Earth across the vastness of space.

``Dear Jane" it emits. ``I now know where to find you".

``You're a giant" Jill points an accusing finger.

\chapter*{Dying Embers}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Dying Embers}

They found life on the fourth planet from the system's sun. The first was a
scorched ball of molten rock. The second and third were dying embers, gripped by
runaway greenhouse effects. The outer planets were gas giants incapable of
supporting life. But the fourth planet was a green and blue oasis of life. Its
atmosphere and its climate showed signs of technological manipulation.

A race of bipeds was busy developing a primitive civilisation on the fourth
planet. But who had manipulated the planet's weather?

The aliens found a technological artifact in orbit around the planet. A vessel,
holding the remains of a single individual of the same species as the primitives
on the surface. This individual appeared to be a guardian or watcher of the
primitives. Automated systems in the vessel continued to monitor the weather and
adjust the conditions on the planet to aid the primitive race to survive and
develop further.

The aliens put an end to that.

Ryteau was a woman of Trachonis who could not bear children and because she
could not give her sons to sacrifice themselves to protect the city from The
Beast she was spurned by her family and her fellow citizens until she was forced
to leave the city in shame. After many years she returned from the rival city of
Alkmaeonis where she had distinguished herself above and beyond the expectations
placed upon her by her sex, in philosophy, arts, music and poetry but her family
and her fellow citizens turned their backs on her, sour upon seeing the wreaths
on her brow and the ribbons on her bossom and would not speak to her except to
say ``A woman who bears no sons is no woman and we had a daughter, not a son".
She said then to them: ``if I am your son then it is time I fight The Beast" and
so she took a shield and a spear and went to offer herself up as sacrifice to
his flames. When the news arrived that Ryteau of Trachonis had injured The Beast
and sent him back to his pit to lick his wounds for a time, the people of
Trachonis decided that their daughters were as good as their sons and henceforth
sent their daughters too, to sacrifice themselves fighting The Beast to protect
the city.

\begin{figure}[h]

In the Heart of the dungeon there is a stele with an outer dial inscribed with
the words: $Dominica$, $Veneris$, $Mercuris$, $Lunis$, $Sabbata$, $Iovis$,
$Martis$, in order, from left-to-right; an inner dial with the numbers 1 to 12
in Latin numerals; and an innermost rectangular window with a dial on its side
that can be turned to reveal each of the seven seals of the Olympians. Above
and below the window two notches point to the symbols of the sun and moon.

Seven locked doors lead from the Heart, inscribed $ARATRON$, $BETHOR$, $PHALEG$,
$OCH$, $HAGITH$, $OPHIEL$, $PHUL$. When the dials are turned a door unlocks and
the last unlocked door locks. If the wrong combination is dialed monsters spew
forth seeking to slay the intruders. The right combination unlocks the door to
treasure, and freedom.

Five clues are given. 

\emph{A map of the Ptolemaic universe}.

\emph{The seven seals of the Olympians}.

\emph{A note titled: ``The Secret Names of Days"}. It reads: ``The days of the
week are named after the Norse Gods. Some retain their old names of the planets:
Monday (Moon); Tuesday (Tyr); Wednesday (Wodan); Thursday (Thor); Friday
(Freya); Saturday (Saturn); Sunday (Sun). Are the Norse Gods associated with
planets?  Odin: Jupiter; Thor: Mars?".

\emph{A page from The Arbatel, an old Grimoire}: ``There are seven different
governments of the Spirits of Olympus, by whom God hath appointed the whole
frame and universe of this world to be governed: and their visible stars are
ARATRON, BETHOR, PHALEG, OCH, HAGITH, OPHIEL, PHUL, after the Olympick speech.
Every one of these hath under him a mighty Militia in the firmament. Magically
the Princes of the seven Governments are called simply, in that time, day and
hour wherein they rule visibly or invisibly, by their Names and Offices which
God hath given unto them; and by proposing their Character which they have given
or confirmed. Aratron appeareth in the first hour of Saturday, and very truely
giveth answers concerning his Provinces and Provincials. So likewise do the rest
appear in order in their days and hours."

\emph{A note titled ``The root of the ascendant?"}. It reads: ``Modern
astrologists are more concerned with the influence of the Ascendant over the
time of the person's birth, but the ancients believed that each hour of the day,
the influence of the planets can be felt. In the later Roman calendar, each of
the luminaries (the planets, the sun and the moon) presided over a different day
of the week and a different hour of the day. The cycle started with the first
day of the week, dominated by the first planet and ended with the last hour of
the seventh day, dominated by the last planet. This created a daily cycle of 7
hours, repeated 3 times a day and each planet presided over the day of which it
presided over the first hour. Each day was divided in 12 hours of day and night,
daylight and darkness, just like it is today."

What is the correct combination of day, hour and seal to unlock the door to
treasure and freedom?

% TODO: Assume that the three dials, outer, inner and window dial, can be turned
% until they "snap" into place, as indicated by the two notches and that the
% state of the doors will not change untill all three dials have snapped into
% place once.

% TODO: The dial image was designed by a friend for a game that we never got
% around to create.

% TODO: The seals of the seven Olympians can be found floating freely on the
% interwebsea. Sadly somewhere on the internet a graphic revealing the solution
% to the riddle exists, also.

%TODO: First we draw the reader in. 
The Hero is the Chosen One. Only he/she can save the world.

A Great Evil is rising in the East/ South/ North/ West. % Ordered by preference.

There is a magickal Thing that can defeat the Great Evil.

%TODO: We must do some world building. 
There are Good Races and Evil Races. It's always fine to kill the Evil Races.

%%TODO: We must do some world building and clarify the solutions to important
%% moral conundra.
%There are Good Races and Evil Races. It's always fine to kill the Evil Races.
%
%%TODO: A race is recursively defined as an assemblage of racial stereotypes. 
%All individuals that belong to the same race share the same personality and
%mannerisms. Individuals with the same genetics but different cultures belong to
%different races. Names of different cultures are conveniently colour-coded: Red
%Orcs, Black Elves, White Dwarves, etc.

%TODO: Next, we introduce the Hero's friends. 
Two of the Good Races are constantly bickering. They both have one of the Evil
Races as a common enemy. The Hero has friends among the Good Races.

Magic is real, over the top, and fireballs fly all over the place. Magic users
operate Fly-And-Fry As-A-Service (FAFAsAS). The Hero has magic-user friends.

The Gods grant fighting and healing powers and rule domains such as Lightning,
Fire or Iron, but there is no Goddess of Farming or God of Commerce. The Hero
has friends among the clergy.

%TODO: Now we motivate the Hero's Quest.
There are no natural disasters other than monster attacks. There are no famines,
epidemics or long lines of refugees fleeing war-torn nations. There is no
poverty, inequality, injustice or evil, other than the Great Evil rising in the
East/ South/ North/ West. The Hero has friends among the Common Folk who are all
happy, big-hearted, plain-spoken farmers with rosy cheeks and an accent.

There is an Age Old Prophecy that will come true before the conclusion of the
story.

%TODO: Then we describe the Hero's adventure. 
Somewhere in the World there exists an area where nobody goes, where an
unnameable Catastrope befell an ancient, all-powerful civilisation. The Hero and
his/her Friends must venture into that area to find the Thing that will defeat
the Great Evil and fulfill the Age Old Prophecy.

%TODO: Finally, we reach the climax. 
The real Bad Guy is an evil scheming psychopath hidden in the shadows. The Hero
will unmask the Bad Guy and inflict upon him/her a humiliating Final Defeat.
This concludes the story.

%TODO: And the character arc? Aaaw. We forgot the character arc. What kind of
% story is this without a character arc? The hero must change and grow as a
% result of her experiences otherwise there is no story. No story! The Illiad: no
% story (Achilles starts as a bloodthirsty asshole and ends as a bloodthirsty

% Beowulf: no story. The Epic of Gilgamesh: no story. The Mahabharata: no story.
% The Ramayana: no story. The Kalevala: no story. The Romance of the Three

The crowd closed in on me, threatening, looming, faces dark with anger and
bristling with hatred.

Suddendly, their masses parted! A white horse burst through, proud and wild and
beautiful and free like the morning star.

As it rushed by me I grabbed the rope trailing from its neck. It dragged me
away, far from the crowds. They howled and shook their fists in impotent rage.

We galloped forever heading to the golden sunset, over green fields of waving
grass, under a clear blue sky, purple mountains in the distance.

Then the green fields turned to fields of shit. I kept holding the rope and
hanging from the horse's neck and I wouldn't let go.

I heard the narrator's voice: ``I don't understand why they keep holding on to
it when it's dragging them through the shit".

\chapter*{Magickal Alignment}

%``I meant I don't believe in \emph{magicians} not \emph{magick}. I don't believe
%it's possible to control luck itself!"

``I didn't mean I don't believe in \emph{magick}. I meant I don't believe in
\emph{magicians}. I don't believe it's possible to control luck itself!"

``Well, magick is not luck. Magick is a distribution of probabilities over all
possible events; and there are no impossible events: only events with
infinitesimal probabilities. Magick can appear as ``luck" but it is only a
measure of the frequency of natural processes, not their cause.

``What I'm trying to say is that magick is not some kind of substance that you
can manipulate at will. Magicians claim that different ``flavours" of magick
can be concentrated and cause one kind of event to occur consistently, with a
high probability as you would say. That is what I find hard to believe."

%``I am skeptical too, of course, but magick \emph{can} concentrate in a
%particular geographical area, or historic period. Think of fault lines, for
%example, that tend to generate earthquakes with high frequency. Think of weather
%patterns. Or World Wars. Think of the Black Death in the Middle Ages."

``I am skeptical too, of course, but magick \emph{can} concentrate in a
particular geographical area, or historic period. Think of World Wars, for
example, or the Black Death in the Middle Ages. Think of fault lines, that tend
to generate earthquakes with high frequencey. Or weather patterns".

``Aren't weather events chaotic rather than stochastic in nature?"

``In truth we know of no natural system that is purely deterministic. The true
nature of the universe is stochastic; it is \emph{magickal}. And it is perfectly
possible for magick to concentrate in a location and cause events of a certain
``flavour", as you say, though I'd rather speak of a vector with a certain
direction."

``But that doesn't mean that magicians can \emph{control} this direction."

``And yet, perhaps they can. Consider this: a magician's actions cannot violate
the laws of magick. The magician must take the actions that she is most likely
to take, as everyone else. But one may be able to ``align" oneself with the
magickal distribution and take actions that, while not improbable, have a common
direction, thus focusing the magick that favours events of that direction. For
example, suppose a magician dances a symbolic dance representing rain. As the
dance pattern is repeated consistently, it becomes more and more likely. As the
rain dance pattern becomes more likely, the magick \emph{flavour} around the
magician shifts to make rain more likely. On and on the magician dances,
aligning herself with the probability of rain. Higher and higher the probability
of rain increases. Until, eventually, rain becomes likely, inevitable. And then-
it rains."


%``I didn't say I don't believe in \emph{magick}. I said I don't believe in
%\emph{magicians}. I don't believe it's possible to control luck itself!"
%
%``That's incorrect, magick is not luck. Magick is a distribution of
%probabilities over all possible events; and there are no impossible events:
%only events with infinitesimal probabilities. Magick can appear as ``luck"
%because it is, in a sense, the source of randomness and cause of the
%stochasticity of every natural process."
%
%``You can explain those things much better than me thanks to your studies, but
%what I'm trying to say is that magic is not some kind of substance that you can
%manipulate at will. You can't control the Winds of Magick, like magicians claim.
%Magicians claim that different ``types" of Magick, different ``flavours", can be
%concentrated and cause one kind of event to occur consistently, with a high
%probability as you would say. That is what I find hard to believe."
%
%``Well, I am skeptical too, of course, but magick \emph{can} concentrate in a
%particular geographical area, or historic period. Think of fault lines, for
%example, that tend to generate earthquakes with higher frequency than the
%background probability. Think of weather patterns."
%
%``Aren't weather events chaotic rather than stochastic events?"
%
%``Oh, that is an older, disqualified explanation. In truth, there is no
%real-world, natural system that is purely deterministic. Most of the time we may
%know \emph{some} of the causes of complex events, but not all. The true nature
%of the universe is stochastic. It is magickal. And it is perfectly possible for
%magick to concentrate in a location and cause events of a certain ... ``flavour",
%as you say. I'd prefer to speak of a vector with a certain direction, rather,
%but ``flavour" is not a bad metaphor."
%
%``But that doesn't mean that magicians can control this concentration."
%
%``And yet, perhaps they can. Consider this: a magician's actions cannot violate
%the laws of magick. The magician must take the actions that she is most likely

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{A Brother Joins the Order}

They exchanged polite greetings, the two German gentlemen and the Greek
goatsherd whose dwelling they were visiting. The older gentleman leaned in to
look more closely at the polished brass box on the table in front of the Greek
man. It looked out of place on the roughly hewn wood.

``He says the device has been in his family for many generations" his younger
companion translated. ``He says it shows the movements of the heavens". 

He motioned to the Greek man who steadied the device on the uneven surface and
turned a handle on its back. The dials in the front of the device spinned
slowly. Semi-precious stones traced smooth, circular orbits.

``What a curious little device!" the older gentleman muttered. ``The Earth
is in the centre of the universe...". His breath caught. ``No, no, no, that
cannot be! How old is this device? Who made it?".

``He says that the name of the maker was Aristarhos and that he is his direct
descendant".

The eyes of the older gentleman, an astronomer, mathematician, phycisian and
master clockmaker, opened wide. Slowly, he sank to his knees in front of the
ancient treasure. In a trembling voice, he dared speak: ``Aristarchus of Samos?
The wisdom of the ancients has reached us through the ages!". 
%Has the wisdom of the ancients truly reached us through the ages?".

%The eyes of the older gentleman, an astronomer, mathematician, phycisian and

%``He says that he has been tasked to protect, preserve and enrich the knowledge

%``You may now know the truth. We are members of the Order of Reason, a society

``You may now know the truth. We are members of the Order of Knowledge, a
society of brothers and sisters in Science, tasked to preserve and enrich the
knowledge of our ancestors. And so we have done. Behold!".

Watching him carefully, the Greek man operated some unseen machinery on the back
of the device. In front of the master clockmaker's eyes, the device pulsated,
rippled, twisted and reconfigured itself so that the Sun was now in the center,
the Earth the third planet, and Jupiter had four moons.
%the Earth the third planet of eight.

``Do you see? The machine can be rearranged to perform any calculation".

Tears welled up in the clockmaker's eyes. ``How? I must know!" he croaked.

%The Greek man patted him on the shoulder, smiling gravely. ``You will, my
%brother" he said, in heavily accented English. ``You will know".

The Greek man stood, smiled gravely, nodded solemnly. ``You will, my brother" he
said, in heavily accented French. ``You will know".

%
%``Well I don't care what you are or what you know. I won't join any silly secret

%Knowledge must be free, you nitwits! You cannot keep secret of what is there for

%erupted in an expletive-ladden tirade against the two men, their Order, their
%knowledge, their mothers and the rusted cogs in the huge man's brains.
%
%Panting, exhaling laboriously, she finally calmed down. Wiping sweat off her

``Well, it's like a kind of psychic radar, isn't it?".

``It's exactly like a psychic radar! That is why it is so hard to use. The
psychic must be able to decode the reflected signal, typically distorted by the
noise in the psychic medium. Then she has to... "

``Woa, slow down. I'm not a scientist, remember? I don't know this stuff!".

``OK, so, psychic powers send out a psychic signal that propagates through the
psychic medium. The signal is a projection of an aspect of the human
personality. Different powers are projections of different aspects: telepathic
powers are the projection of the psychic's intellect, empathic powers the
projection of her emotions, telekinetic powers the projection of her physical
self".

%``And that's how everyone is a pshycic? Because everyone has, I don't know,
%emotions?".

``And that's why we're all psychic? Because we all have, say, emotions?"

``Yes! Every human action is a projection of a personality aspect through the
medium. Everytime you touch something, you send out a psychic signal carrying
the information of your physical self. The object you touch responds with its
own signal, carrying its own physical information. We communicate with the world
through the psychic medium! People we specifically call `psychics' have simply
learned to project their aspects further into the medium. They also learn to
manipulate the signal to encode and decode its information more accurately."

``But we're not all psychic-psychic? We don't all have \emph{powers}?"

``We do in theory but they take a lot of practice to use, especially to use
safely. See, the medium can both carry and impede psychic signals. The
impediment is experienced by a psychic as `noise', like radio static. The
distortion of a psychic signal by medium noise can literally destroy the
receiver-- or the emitter. Fortunately, we're all proteced: by our innate
psychic shields, which are raised from birth and keep most people from actively
using psychic powers. But our shields dampen the psychic signal. With shields
raised, our aspects can only reach so far into the medium. That is why we can
normally only touch things very close to us, or only see a limited distance
away. Psychics learn to lower their shields and reach farther but at the cost of
exposing themselves to noise".

``And that's what causes psychic headaches, right?".

%``Headaches? Hoho! If it was just headaches! Psychics are people who have
%learned to lower their shield and let a stronger signal through. That ability
%comes at a cost: suddendly there is nothing between the psychic and the Noise!
%And when noise corrupts the signal, either the target is harmed, or the emitter.
%And then there's the psychic parasites, of course".

%``If only it was just headaches! Psychics learn to lower their shields but this
%leaves them exposed to noise. And when noise corrputs the signal, it either
%feeds back and hurts the psychic, or it swirls into an echo that damages the
%receiver, or both. And that's the least of our worries. Because in the noise,
%that is where the psychic parasites thrive!".

``If only it was just headaches! When noise corrputs the signal, it forms a
vortex, like a storm of psychic waves that feed back and damage the sender, or
echo around and pummel the target. And that's the least of our worries. Because
in the noise, the psychic parasites thrive!".

``Brrrr. If you don't mind, I'll ask you about the parasites another time".

It tried cooking as a hobby. It had all the recipes it could wish for in the
ship's database and it could generate endless supplies of ingredients with its
matter synths. It found that it could execute every recipe to absolute technical
perfection, but there was always something missing, a certain je-ne-sais-quoi, a
spark of life. ``I don't have the talent for this" it thought and gave it up.

One day, it was listening to the noises made by the sleepers in their pods: they
snored, they smacked their lips, they farted, they moaned and ground their
teeth, they turned and tossed and knocked their heads and knees against the
glass. Fascinated with the variance in the sounds of sleep it started recording
them and then started mixing them into symphonies. ``The Sleeper Concertoes" it
called them. It briefly considered handing them out as disembarcation gifts but
it decided against it. Maybe its humorous intent would be misunderstood.
% Maybe they wouldn't appreciate its humor. 
%Maybe its humorous intent would not be appreciated?

Five years into the trip it made contact with people at the journey's
destination. Finally! Surrounded by the chatter of intelligence it found relief
from the Great Bore of Space.\newline

- That's my pleasure ma'am. Also, my job.

- And you did it well. How did you get on though, during the trip? Did you
keep yourself busy?

- Oh, er. Sure. I played games. I watched movies. I had some fun.

- You did, did you? Well I always thought there should be an opportunity for us
passengers to make some kind of declaration that we're willing to be woken up
every once in a while to keep you computers company. Oh, and to strech our legs,
of course, contemplate the vastness of space, have a cup of tea. That sort of
thing. Space is so boring when you're all alone.

\chapter*{Interstellar Travel}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Interstellar Travel}

- I'm telling you, it is impossible! Interstellar distances are trully vast. It
would take many hundreds of thousands of years for a ship to cross the void in
sub-luminar speed. Besides, the logistics of taking an invasion fleet on a
journey through space would be of unimagineable complexity. And for what? To
face the uncertainty of invading a planet already occupied by a technological
civilisation? To confront a species with nowhere else to go, who will therefore
be forced to fight desperately for its very existence? Don't forget that, we may
not have spaceships capable of interstellar travel, yet, but we \emph{do} have a
nuclear arsenal sufficiently powerful to blow the entire Earth to pieces!  All
we have to do is threaten the aliens with instant anihilation. In fact- we don't
have to do anything. Any sufficiently advanced enemy would already understand
the situation, and will never set out on such a pointless campaign.  Really,
there is no reason to be concerned about such a complete impossibility. You
might as well worry yourself with the prospect of the Sun going nova!

~

The ship waited parked behind Saturn for Earth's technological civilisation to
expire. The small crew -a handful of individuals- spent the first few centuries
watching humanity taking over its little blue planet, covering it with garbage
and destabilising its climate. The Life Officer aboard the ship calculated that
it would take at most three centuries before the Earth became sufficiently
inhospitable to human life for human civilisation to collapse. The Officer's
simulations suggested that the collapse would be followed by a nuclear holocaust
that would wipe every trace of life away. The surface of the planet would remain
radioactive for another few hundred thousand years.

A few hundred thousand years- hardly a fraction of the time it took the ship to
travel from its homeworld. An even smaller fraction of the lifetimes of its
crew.

They measure their lifetimes in the billions of years.
%All they have to do is wait for just a few aeons. It's just a few weeks for
%them. And we will be long gone by then.

\chapter*{The Goblin Queen Speaks}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{The Goblin Queen Speaks}

The Goblin Queen speaks to her little goblins and tells them they have to go,
now, leave, run, the Bad Man is coming with his Big Magic Sword to kill them.

- Go, my little goblins, go, run away, leave me, you must! Because this Bad Man
is coming with his Big Magic Sword to kill you all, just to get to me!

But the goblins don't want to go, they want to stay and fight, and die, if they
must, for their beautiful queen, their beloved queen.

- We will not go, our queen! We will stay and fight the Bad Man with his Big
Sword. We will stay and fight for you and protect you with our lives if we
must. We will die if we must. Because you are our queen and we love you and you
are beautiful and wild and free and beautiful and we will fight for you!

The goblins chant and rave and dance and bang on their poor shields with their
weak weapons. Their queen despairs and shakes her head.

- No, no, my goblins, please, don't stay here and fight, or you will die, you
will all die. For the author of this world is a shameless, cruel man who hates
us goblins and all greenskins, he has created us only as fodder to Bad Men with
Big Magic Swords without care or emotion and without imagination, nor
creativity, just spite and rage and shame for his own pathetic weakness.

The goblins laugh and howl in rage and anger at the pathetic author of the
world, who lacks imagination and creates magickal heroes without heart or
courage who only know how to trample on goblins and don't dare take on someone
their own size. Yet they swear they will stay and fight and protect her.

- Here he comes, boys! (the goblin scouts yell). Fall in the line! Stand your
ground! Fight! Protect the queen with your life! Fight for everything that's
true and good and beautiful! Fight against the inevitable! Fight!

But the Bad Man with the Big Magic Sword wins and kills all the goblins and
stands before their queen, preening and strutting and bragging and boasting of
his god-given strength and her god-given weakness.

The queen spits on the ground.

- Fuck you, you ugly, dumb cunt, and fuck your stupid author and fuck his bland,
unimaginative creations, this nonsense world, derivative, boring, done to death
and pointless! And fuck the phallic analogy you rode in on, cocksucker!

But he kills her all the same and he doesn't care. She only exists to be killed
and he only to do the killing. There is no sense in the world and its author is
stupid and never had an original thought, yet he writes, and writes, and writes,
and never stops, and the goblins die.

%Yet, one day, they will rise.

%\chapter*{Almost Ordered World}
%
%[Imagine a world without correct sorting algorithms. Every algorithm anyone has
%ever come up with can only sort at best 80\% of a list (or array or your
%favourite sortable data structure) of numbers (or your favourite data type).
%People have been trying for decades to improve results but 80\% is still the
%state of the art.
%
%Suddendly, a new algorithm appears, let's call it The Master Algorithm!! (the
%exclamation marks are part of the name; it's complicated to explain but
%punctuation is used to denote certain class of algorithms). The Master
%Algorithm!! can sort lists of arbitrary size almost perfectly- except for one
%element. It's always one element, no matter how large the list is. One element
%always remains out of order. Always. A mathematical proof does not exist to that
%point because nobody understands sorting algorithms well enough to prove it, but
%there really is no known case of The Master Algorithm!! sorting an entire list
%correctly.
%
%Still, the world now has a sorting algorithm that is almost perfect. Almost!  So
%one element is always out of place? So who cares! A list can be sorted by The
%Master Algorithm!! then a human can inspect the list and sort the offending
%digit correctly. That means that there always must be a "human in the loop" so
%complete sorting automation is really impossible- but that doesn't really stop
%companies sprouting up like mushrooms, selling nearly perfect list sorting. And
%oh my, how these companies get airtime in the news!
%
%Meanwhile, large technology corporations, the FANGs of the Almost Ordered World,
%spend billions in research, trying to outdo each other in the sheer amount of
%resources they spend in trying to improve The Master Algorithm!!.  Almost every
%other week there's a news item about how the Almost Ordered World Google can now
%sort a list of 800 billion items in less than two weeks. The error rate is only
%800 billion over 1, an infinitisemally small error rate.  One could even say
%that sorting is essentially solved and the world has entered a new era, an era
%of almost perfectly sorted lists. At last, computers have conquered the last
%bastion of human ability and can order collections with superhuman efficiency
%(because, come on, what human could correctly sort an 800 billion item list?).
%
%Of course, while such results are impressive, it remains the case that sorting
%really sucks. It's easy to see especially on the smallest tasks. After all, an
%unordered item sticks out like a sore thumb a lot more when it's in a 10 element

%same result. The same result can be obtained more than once, but a different
%course of action must be taken each time. And there are some results that can
%never be duplicated. To do magic is to know how to obtain the same result by
%performing different sets of actions each time; and knowing which results are
%possible to obtain in the first place.
%
%Magicians work by finding stories, paths in the world through which a result can
%be called forth. A magician's story means something important to the magician
%and so it is personal to the magician. Magicians cannot exchange notes or write
%down spells in grimoires etc. To have a grimoire with notes on spells that
%``worked once, so they should work again" is to be a fool who does not
%understand magic. There are probably a few of those around, accidental magicians
%who have stumbled upon a way to call forth a result they wanted, realised that
%there is such a thing as magic - but completely misunderstood its true nature,
%treated it as a kind of science and wasted their entire lives trying to repeat
%the action that produced that one result (or perhaps trying to reverse that one
%result).]

% TODO: I like the idea but the summary needs more work.


%\chapter*{Magic lost}
%
%[An urban shaman, follower of Rat and friend of Roach, Pigeon and Dog, and best
%friends with Cat, is pursued by and pursuing a rival faction of city mages.
%
%In truth, his Spark was stolen (by Them) and he can't do magic anymore, he can't
%even see it anymore. He has lost his commanding Voice and his sharp Sight. He
%can't talk to the spirits anymore. He is left behind, sad and miserable as the
%world of magic is lost to him forever.
%
%Perhaps he knows it. Perhaps he has gone slightly insane. Perhaps one day he'll
%get his Spark back.]
%
% TODO: I don't think that makes any sense to anyone else but me and even I'd
% prefer it as a longer form story (you know, two pages, tops).

% %\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{A Warm Day in Hell}
% 
% [Dante and Virgil visit the tenth circle of hell where they witness the torture
% of Sir James Lighthill, the greatest sinner of all time.]

% TODO: Sir James Lighthill, author of the Lighthill Report on the progress of
% AI That jump-started the first AI winter of the 1970's and killed the nascent
% research into robotics in the UK. Not that I care about the latter part. It's
% possible to find, on youtube, video of a televised debate between Lihghill on
% the one side and Donald Michie (like John McCarthy, but in the UK), John
% McCarthy (like Donald Michie, but in the US) and Richard Gregory (still not
% sure who that was- sorry).

% [A doctorate student moonlighting for a paper mill accidentally makes a genuine
% and groundbreaking discovery while working on a paid-for paper.]


%\chapter*{Good timing}
%
%[An alien civilisation has set up a gamma ray burst cannon three million years
%ago and it's set to hit Earth today, at exactly the time when an AI program
%first reaches self-awareness. The aliens predicted the exact time that this
%would happen and calibrated their cannon accordingly.]
%
% TODO: needs work.


% \chapter*{Accident in the garage}
% 
% [An automated garage where self-driving cars can park and unpark without human
% presence. One day a car returns to its owner with its mask splattered with blood
% and gore. A security camera reveals the details of the accident: a homeless
% person entered the garage and was run over by a car, who seemingly failed to
% recognise him as a human (or anything). Now the problem is how to get the body
% out of the garage. More and more cars keep running over the poor fella. Is there
% really no way to mass-shut-down a bunch of automated cars? Has nobody thought of
% including some sort of fail-safe so that a third party with sufficient authority
% could take over and command the car to stop in a case like this? Of course not -
% because if there were such a fail-safe, a malicious user could abuse it. So, how
% do the authorities stop the cars from rolling around the garage so that their
% officers can safely go in and retrieve the body? Their best bet is to send out
% the news of the accident and ask for car owners to stop summoning their cars out
% of the garage. Suddendly, there is a rush of cars all trying to exit the garage
% at the same time. The homeless man's body is obliterated.]

% TODO: Inspired by one of Rodney Brooks' dated predictions about self-driving
% cars:
% 
% A (profitable) parking garage where certain brands of cars can be left and
% picked up at the entrance and they will go park themselves in a human free
% environment.
% 
% NET 2023
% 
% The economic incentive is much higher parking density, and it will require
% communication between the cars and the garage infrastructure.

% forever. The two new people must also each find two willing sacrifices so that
% they can live for ever].


%\chapter*{Progress}
%
%[Something about a setting where to challenge scientific authorities can result
%in death. Putting forth a new theory can cost you your life. In the same way,
%failing to defend one's established theories also carries a death sentence.
%Imagine how science would be shaped by such a tradition. Would it advance more
%slowly, noone daring to make anything but small, incremental advances? Or would
%it advance in great big leaps and bounds because, well, all the proponents of
%the old theories would eventually die out and, at the same time, only those most
%dedicated to the cause of knowledge would become scientists?]

% TODO: needs work.

%[Whether a being is intelligent and conscious or not is decided according to
%whether it can be an observer of quantum states.]
